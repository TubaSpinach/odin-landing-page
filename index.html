            <p>Between somewhen house walls an onion bulb is sitting. Beautiestly onionsits. Preciselier, anonionsits siderways, undertween decomposing leaves and hardened clayers.

                Each morn, noontime's approach, the sun lamps over the onionhead. 
                Inbare a day, haps per two,
                oniongrow shoot aboveways the decomposing leaves.
                
                Word light betwixt crumple dirt penetrate
                --daresay the shoot of its head onionsits green--
                But light through crumple dirt is hard work, and so is oniongrowin.
                
                Nowwise, anyways, the onionshoot lays siderways, mayhap green,
                onionasking for headways the sun to lamp again.
                    
                Haps that is far per the point. Knowerly oniongrow hap ins with out us
                --insofar as the decomposing leaves and hardened clayers lay be out twixt ourselves--
                only we can wecall onionbeauty an onionbeautiest. 
                
                What is, importantwise, is that oniongrowin hap ins. 
                From layers, through clayers and crumple dirt and decomposing leaves, a type of light
                penetrate betterly than what lamps from the sun and oniongrows mayhap green shoots. 
                
                Lightahope, candle hap out flame. 
                Between somewhen house walls, onionfire, mayhap green.</p>
